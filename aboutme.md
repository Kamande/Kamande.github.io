I failed the Normal Test for Conventionality.

I am a Data Scientist with a Statistics background (MSc) and currently finishing up an MSc in Computer Science (Computational Intelligence). I lead Data Science at mSurvey, focusing of Data products and powered by R. I deride a lot of pleasure in unearthing bits of information from data sets, and seeing clients grow based on the data driven insights provided. I focus on the data, the tools, and most importantly, the narratives. Looking back, I believe my first job as a junior statistician at mSurvey set me on this trajectory. I have previously also worked as a research assistant, business analyst and Data Scientist at Nielsen - very imperative pieces of my learning curve so far.

I am part of the Organizers of the Data Science Nairobi meet-up. We convene once a month, with two great presenters from various industries on Deck per meet-up. We also organize stochastic specialized and technical meet-ups (R, Python, Julia etc.)

I enjoy football and rugby, and the fascinating data around the two games- Maybe one day Opta will need an African correspondent. I enjoy playing squash and exercise. I, albeit shortly, was a stage actor - my love for the arts is still intact. I love a good play, and a good show; Like THE WIRE.

THE WIRE taught me that A man MUST have a Code. Mine, is an overload of ethic and compassion.

I also enjoy a good book - like the Godfather, Tools of Titans, or The Signal and The noise - and recently took up hiking.
