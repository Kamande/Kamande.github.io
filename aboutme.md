subtitle: Why you should probably not ignore me

I failed the Normal Test for Conventionality.

I am a Data Scientist with a Statistics background (MSc) and currently finishing up an MSc in Computer Science (Computational Intelligence). I should also mention that I am a lame jokes artiste at home. I lead Data Science at mSurvey, focusing of Data products and powered by R. I deride a lot of pleasure in unearthing bits of information from data sets, and seeing clients grow based on the data driven insights provided. I focus on the data, the tools, and most importantly, the narratives. Looking back, I believe my first job as a junior statistician at mSurvey set me on this trajectory. I have previously also worked as a research assistant, business analyst and Data Scientist at Nielsen - very imperative pieces of my learning curve so far.

I am part of the Organizers of the Data Science Nairobi meet-up. We convene once a month, with great presenters from various industries on Deck. We also organize stochastic specialized and technical meet-ups (R, Python, Julia etc.) as we build an engaged and vibrant community of Data Scientists in Kenya.

I host the [Prime Your State Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/pys-with-kamande/), in which I talk to young, hungry and driven minds in East Africa on how they remain committed and consistent in their endeavours; there is a significant bias towards tech.

I enjoy football and rugby, and the fascinating data around the two games- I harbour diminishing dreams of becoming Opta's Africa correspondent. I am keen on fitness and squash . I, albeit shortly, was a stage actor - my love for the arts is still intact. I love a good play, and a good show; Like THE WIRE. THE WIRE taught me that A man MUST have a Code. Mine, is an overload of ethic and compassion.

Here, I publish random write ups on insights from interesting Data and things that keep me up at night. You might notice a leaning towards sports, my consistently sweet and sour spot.
