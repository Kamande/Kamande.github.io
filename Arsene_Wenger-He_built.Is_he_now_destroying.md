I remeber watching Bergkhamp, Henry, Pires, Edu, Gilberto, Viera etc rip teams into pieces. I remember tham also having a bad day but the big cojones to fight to the end were never in question. Then, Wenger, Arsene Wenger. I could have sworn Arsenal was named after this great man. I revered him greatly, as did many of us, I am sure. Access to Arsenal matches on a regular was not as easy as it has become now, but that did not deter my/our resolve to catch every single game possible. When inaccessible, we'd listen to the matches on Radio. We'd read the papers the next day and cut out pictures of Ljunberg and stick it on the next page of this wonderful collection book.

The subsequent years have been thorny, with roses every now and then. Roses that whip up some hope of a return to the yesteryears, but then the thorns come pricking into the hopes so horridly, you give up ever hoping. Until a fresh rose enmerges the next season, and the bloody vicious and exasperating cycle continues. I wished on so many days that I did not feel this much about a club so far away, feel this much about people that will never know or even care about by existence let alone my endless thoughts and emotions about them. I have contemplated and even discussed the possibility of this being a severe case of stockholm syndrome orchestrated by Arsene. Seriously. Until two seasons ago when I intentionally started working on directing my emotions towards my other favorite teams - Real Madrid, Hurricanes and Kenya Harlequins. It has been a transformation, mentally. My Mondays are more bearable.

That said, I still care about Arsenal, and what has transpired this season has been especially conspicuous from a data stand point. I could not help but notice a few things that reinforce my opinion about it being the end of Arsene's road, sadly. It is a desolate situation. There are many pieces of information that I/most of us are not privy to besides what takes place on the pitch, pieces like this informative [thread](https://twitter.com/DarrenArsenal1/status/969514628056264705) from @DarrenArsenal1 on twitter, but my sentiments are based on a strickly team performance basis. That is what matters to us in the end. Losing 8-2 to United with a solid bottomline might not be the worst situation for the club, but it is for the fans. My goodness, we have endured. 6-0 at Stamford Bridge. 15-3 aggregate against Bayern Munich. 5-1 at Liverpool. I could go on.

How about a yummy crepe?

![Crepe](http://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cQ1Yoa75m2yUFFbY2xwuqw/348s.jpg)

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
